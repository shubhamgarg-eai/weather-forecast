Weather App Documentation
Project Overview
This project is a weather application that provides users with the temperature forecast for the last 5 days in a specified country. Users can view temperatures in both Celsius and Fahrenheit. The app includes a search box that allows users to easily search for weather data by country.

Key Features
5-Day Temperature Forecast: Displays the temperature for the last 5 days.
Unit Conversion: Users can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Search Functionality: Users can search for any country to get the corresponding weather data.
Dependencies
To set up and run this project, the following dependencies are required:

bash
Copy code
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
npm install --save redux react-redux
Redux Toolkit
The Redux Toolkit is used for managing the application state in a predictable manner. It simplifies the process of writing Redux logic.

React-Redux
React-Redux connects React components to the Redux store, allowing them to access and dispatch actions.

Project Structure
The project follows an atomic design structure, ensuring that components are organized into reusable units:

    └── main.css         // Main stylesheet for the application
Implementation Details
1. 5-Day Temperature Forecast
The app retrieves weather data for the last 5 days using an external weather API. This data is then processed and displayed to the user in a user-friendly format.

2. Unit Conversion
Users can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The app converts the temperature data dynamically based on the selected unit.

3. Search Functionality
A search box allows users to input the name of a country. Upon submission, the app fetches and displays the weather data for that specific country.

4. State Management with Redux
Redux is used to manage the application state, including current weather data and forecasts. The weatherSlice contains actions and reducers to handle fetching and updating weather data.
5. Lazy Loading
The app uses lazy loading to improve performance by splitting the code into smaller chunks. This way, components are loaded only when needed, which helps reduce the initial load time.

6. Atomic Design
The application is organized using atomic design principles, allowing for better modularity and reusability of components. Components are categorized into atoms, molecules, organisms, and templates.

Implementation Details
1. 5-Day Temperature Forecast
The app retrieves weather data for the last 5 days using an external weather API. This data is then processed and displayed to the user in a user-friendly format.

2. Unit Conversion
Users can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The app converts the temperature data dynamically based on the selected unit.

3. Search Functionality
A search box allows users to input the name of a country. Upon submission, the app fetches and displays the weather data for that specific country.

Search Component Code:
javascript
Copy code
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Search = ({ onSearch }) => {
    const [city, setCity] = useState('');

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        if (city) {
            onSearch(city);
            setCity('');
        }
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="search-form">
            <input
                type="text"
                placeholder="Search city..."
                value={city}
                onChange={(e) => setCity(e.target.value)}
            />
            <button type="submit">Search</button>
        </form>
    );
};

export default Search;
4. State Management with Redux
Redux is used to manage the application state, including current weather data and forecasts. The weatherSlice contains actions and reducers to handle fetching and updating weather data.

Example of Redux Slice:
javascript
Copy code
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const weatherSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'weather',
    initialState: {
        currentWeather: null,
        forecast: [],
        loading: false,
        unit: 'Celsius',
    },
    reducers: {
        fetchWeatherStart(state) {
            state.loading = true;
        },
        fetchWeatherSuccess(state, action) {
            state.currentWeather = action.payload.currentWeather;
            state.forecast = action.payload.forecast;
            state.loading = false;
        },
        fetchWeatherFailure(state, action) {
            state.loading = false;
            // Handle error
        },
        toggleUnit(state) {
            state.unit = state.unit === 'Celsius' ? 'Fahrenheit' : 'Celsius';
        },
    },
});

export const {
    fetchWeatherStart,
    fetchWeatherSuccess,
    fetchWeatherFailure,
    toggleUnit,
} = weatherSlice.actions;

export default weatherSlice.reducer;
5. Lazy Loading
The app uses lazy loading to improve performance by splitting the code into smaller chunks. This way, components are loaded only when needed, which helps reduce the initial load time.

6. Atomic Design
